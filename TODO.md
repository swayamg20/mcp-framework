## TODO

- SSE route
- create and access the MCPs directly from the command and not from some node server
- not just the developer experience but the experience of deployment mcp should also get very smooth
- the OAuth callbacks are not working right now


## Furture Ideas

- functionality to use any agentic LLM to make MCPs
